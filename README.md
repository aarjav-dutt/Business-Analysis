Digital Product Management


Product managers can have a tremendous impact on a technology company's performance. PMs define a product's functional requirements and then lead a team responsible for its development, launch, and ongoing improvement. 


We will be addressing the following issues:

•	What does a PM do and with whom do they work at different stages of the product life cycle? What are the attributes of successful and unsuccessful PMs?

•	What techniques do PMs use to understand customer needs and validate demand?

•	What does a PM need to know about user experience design?

•	What is a Market Requirement Document (MRD)? How to build the effective MRDs and Use Cases?

•	What is a Product Requirement Document (PRD)? Why do some tech companies use them while others do not?

•	What is the difference between waterfall and agile software development methods, and when/why would firms chose one over the other?

•	What approaches (e.g., project planning software, face-to-face meetings, etc.) do PMs use to track progress and coordinate their team's efforts?

•	How should a PM approach wireframing? What do they need to know about UX design?

•	What does a PM need to know about technology, e.g., model-view-controller architecture, APIs, databases, cloud?
